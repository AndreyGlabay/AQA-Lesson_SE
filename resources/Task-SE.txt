(0) Create new Java Maven Project.
    - (a) Change the project structure from "src/main/java/com.example.school.test" to the
      "src/main/java/com.example"
    - (b) Add to the project structure dir "/resources" with Task's solution description file Task-SE.txt
    - (c) pom.xml: add dependencies from Maven repo for Selenium and TestNG, and rebuild Project.
    - (d) gitignore: modify the file by adding more rules.


(1) Create package /src/test/java/com.example.test and test class ChromeTest in this package.
    - (a) Test Class ChromeTest: implement annotation @Test with test method testChrome().
    - (b) ChromeTest @Test testChrome(): implements new driver with WebDriver for Chrome.
    - (c) ChromeTest: Implements new var with URL for website visiting.
    - (d) ChromeTest @Test testChrome(): implements new instance for website visiting with the driver.
    - (e) ChromeTest @Test testChrome(): get Title from the website.
    - (f) ChromeTest @Test testChrome(): assert the Title.


(2) Copy annotation @Test and change the driver from Chrome to FireFox.
    - (a) ChromeTest @Test testFirefox(): implements new driver with WebDriver for FireFox.
    - (b) ChromeTest @Test testFirefox(): implements new instance for website visiting with the driver.
    - (c) ChromeTest @Test testFirefox(): get Title from the website.
    - (d) ChromeTest @Test testFirefox(): assert the Title.


(3) Create a separate test class and move testFireFox() to it.


(4) Create var for driver and move driver opening & closing to @Before & @After to stop instances from multiplying:
    - (a) Test classes ChromeTest & FireFoxTest: move driver opening to @BeforeTest
    - (b) Test classes ChromeTest & FireFoxTest: move driver closing to @AfterTest

(5) Set up Selenium Server (Grid)
    - (a) https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ -> Selenium Server (Grid) -> download Latest stable version (4.17.0);
    - (b) In the dir with downloading file open terminal (Win) R.click -> Open in terminal -> PowerShell ->
          -> execute command -> java -jar ./selenium-server-4.17.0.jar standalone --port 6789 ->
          -> Selenium Server (Grid) standalone going to run.


(6) Implements test class for test run on the remote computer (in this task still local - localhost)
    - (a) Copy test class ChromeTest and rename it to RemoteChromeTest (ChromeTest -> Refactor -> CopyClass)
    - (b) Test class RemoteChromeTest: Initiate gridUrl var with HTTP + localhost + port num;
    - (c) RemoteChromeTest: Initiate options var with ChromeOptions();
    - (d) RemoteChromeTest @BeforeTest: Modify driver opening with RemoteWebDriver();

 * NOTE: In this task, we use local PC for demo - localhost; IRL we're gonna to use predefined PC with Grid on it;

(7)
    - (a) RemoteChromeTest @Test: using driver get URL + EP;
    - (b) RemoteChromeTest @Test: et element with class name;
    - (c) RemoteChromeTest @Test: Assert that in the class there is the text "Text Box";

** NOTE: Before test run should be running standalone agent - from Terminal, using command
         java -jar ./selenium-server-4.17.0.jar standalone --port 6789
